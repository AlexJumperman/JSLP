- Create a JS file and write a simple encryption function that returns a string made of 0s and 1s as follows:
  - Takes a sentence as the argument;
  - For each word in the sentence (we consider a word any series of characters separated by space):
    - Uses 0 if the length is divisible by 3;
    - Uses 1 otherwise;
  - Returns the “encrypted” string.
- Create an HTML page and load the JS file.
- Call the function for different sentences and log the results in the browser’s console.
