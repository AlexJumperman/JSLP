- Create a JS file and write a function that:
  - Checks all the numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive);
  - For multiples of 5 prints to the console Ping instead of the actual number;
  - For multiples of 7 prints Pong;
  - For multiples of both 5 and 7 prints PingPong;
  - For any other situation prints the actual number.
- Create an HTML page and load the JS file to see the results in the browser’s console.
- Create another function that returns a string with the values concatenated, using the same logic as above.
- Call this function and display the result in the browser’s console.
- Refactor the code above so that the conversion logic isn’t duplicated between the two functions.
